    "# Objective\n",
    "Main Task is to understand food insecurities from the given news articles. Secondary to it, but most likely critical, is to find a way to predict food insecurities given the limited data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It seems I am also allowed to work with external (open) data sources as long as I document and provide it properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open Questions: \n",
    "* What does it mean to understand food insecurities. What kind of insights can I extract from the data that add to understanding of food insecurities?\n",
    "* I could assume what I can extract from the articles are potentially frequent location of food insecurities and potentially the context in which they occur - for instance, are they frequently mentioned along some conflict or other geopolitical occcurence - how would I extract this in a statistically sound way? Would co-occurence in the text be enough or would I need to ensure they are also semantically linked - how to do that?\n"

    "* Arabic risk-factors are not given and hence I have to use some translation API here. Probably google translation API to keep it simple, or some LLM call.\n",
    "* I have geospatial information of specific locations - this will help to map/visualise hotspots or frequently occuring/mentioned places related to food insecurities?\n",
